## Vision & Philosophy

### What We're Building
A platform where users type what they need in plain English, and an intelligent system automatically creates the right agents, tools, and visualizations to deliver insights - without any predefined types, templates, or categories.

### Core Principles
1. **NO TYPES**: No panel types, no simulation types, no templates
2. **Pure Intelligence**: Every request is understood and handled uniquely
3. **Emergent Solutions**: The system figures out the best approach
4. **Universal Interface**: One text box handles everything
5. **Intelligence Over Features**: Don't build features, build understanding

### Key Insight
Monte Carlo simulations aren't special - they're just many agents responding independently. Panels aren't special - they're just few agents discussing. Everything emerges from understanding the user's need.

## Core Architecture

### The Entire System in One Function

```typescript
async function hawkingEdison(input: string, context?: Context): Promise<Result> {
  // 1. Understand what they want
  const understanding = await understand(input, context);
  
  // 2. Figure out how to do it
  const approach = await designApproach(understanding);
  
  // 3. Do it
  const result = await execute(approach);
  
  // 4. Show it
  return await present(result, understanding);
}
```

### The Four Core Components

#### 1. Understanding Engine
```typescript
// No categorization, just deep understanding
async function understand(input: string, context?: Context) {
  return await llm.think(`
    Input: ${input}
    Context: ${context}
    
    What does this person want to know or achieve?
    What would success look like?
    Don't categorize. Just understand deeply.
  `);
}
```

#### 2. Approach Designer
```typescript
// Figures out the best way to handle the request
async function designApproach(understanding: Understanding) {
  return await llm.design(`
    Goal: ${understanding.goal}
    
    Design an approach:
    - How many agents would help? (1? 5? 1000?)
    - Should they interact or respond independently?
    - What capabilities do they need?
    
    There's no template. Be creative.
  `);
}
```

#### 3. Execution Engine
```typescript
// Creates agents and lets them work
async function execute(approach: Approach) {
  const agents = await createAgents(approach.agentSpec);
  const capabilities = await provideCapabilities(approach.needs);
  
  // Let them work based on approach
  if (approach.pattern === "discussion") {
    return await facilitateDiscussion(agents, approach);
  } else if (approach.pattern === "independent") {
    return await gatherResponses(agents, approach);
  } else {
    return await executeCustom(agents, approach);
  }
}
```

#### 4. Presentation Engine
```typescript
// Creates perfect visualization for the results
async function present(result: Result, understanding: Understanding) {
  // Supervisor agent creates custom dashboard
  const supervisor = new VisualizationSupervisor();
  const dashboard = await supervisor.createVisualization(result, understanding);
  
  // Validate before showing
  const validated = await supervisor.validate(dashboard, result);
  return validated;
}
```

## Implementation Guide

### Phase 1: Core Intelligence (Weeks 1-3)

#### Week 1: Basic Flow
```typescript
// Files to create:
src/
  core/
    understand.ts    // Natural language understanding
    approach.ts      // Approach design
    execute.ts       // Execution engine
    present.ts       // Presentation engine
  lib/
    llm.ts          // LLM interface (Claude)
    supabase.ts     // Database client
```

#### Week 2: Agent System
```typescript
// Dynamic agent creation
class Agent {
  constructor(private spec: AgentSpec) {}
  
  async respond(input: any) {
    return await llm.respond({
      persona: this.spec.persona,
      expertise: this.spec.expertise,
      input: input
    });
  }
}
```

#### Week 3: Capability System
```typescript
// Auto-generated, verified capabilities
class Capability {
  static async create(need: string) {
    const code = await llm.generateCapability(need);
    const tests = await llm.generateTests(need);
    
    if (await this.verify(code, tests)) {
      return new Capability(code);
    }
    
    // Fallback: LLM does it directly
    return new Capability(async (input) => 
      await llm.perform(need, input)
    );
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Production Features (Weeks 4-6)

#### Week 4: Visualization System
```typescript
// Intelligent dashboard generation
class VisualizationSupervisor {
  async createVisualization(results: any, goal: string) {
    const strategy = await this.planVisualization(results, goal);
    const dashboard = await this.generateMarkdownSVG(results, strategy);
    return await this.validate(dashboard, results);
  }
}
```

#### Week 5: Knowledge System
```typescript
// User's personal knowledge base
class KnowledgeBase {
  async search(query: string) {
    // Vector similarity search
    return await supabase
      .from('knowledge')
      .select()
      .textSearch('embedding', query)
      .limit(10);
  }
}
```

#### Week 6: Real-time & Streaming
```typescript
// Stream results as they happen
class StreamingEngine {
  async stream(interaction: Interaction) {
    const channel = supabase.channel(`interaction-${interaction.id}`);
    
    // Stream agent responses
    interaction.on('agent-response', (response) => {
      channel.send({ type: 'response', data: response });
    });
    
    // Stream visualization updates
    interaction.on('visualization-update', (viz) => {
      channel.send({ type: 'visualization', data: viz });
    });
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: Scale & Polish (Weeks 7-9)

#### Week 7: Performance
- Semantic caching (not type-based)
- Smart batching for multiple agents
- Cost optimization through routing

#### Week 8: User Experience
- Onboarding flow
- Example interactions
- Export capabilities

#### Week 9: API & Integrations
- Single `/api/interact` endpoint
- Webhook support
- Browser extension

## Key Principles to Remember

### Development Mantras
1. **"No types, no templates"** - Let intelligence emerge
2. **"Can the LLM figure this out?"** - Always yes
3. **"Surprise is good"** - Unexpected solutions are creative solutions
4. **"One function to rule them all"** - Everything goes through the same flow

### What Success Looks Like
- Zero hardcoded workflows
- Handles requests we never imagined
- Different approaches for similar requests
- Users succeed without documentation

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Creating enums or types for requests
- Building specific handlers for use cases
- Assuming what users need
- Over-engineering the solution

### Architecture Checklist
- [ ] No "PanelType" enum
- [ ] No "SimulationType" class  
- [ ] No template library
- [ ] No special case handlers
- [ ] Just understanding → approach → execute → present

## Quick Reference

### When Building a Feature
1. **Don't** create a new type
2. **Don't** add a special handler
3. **Do** enhance understanding
4. **Do** let approach emerge
5. **Do** trust the intelligence

### When Something Seems Complex
1. **Ask**: "Why can't the LLM handle this?"
2. **Try**: Giving LLM more context
3. **Avoid**: Adding structure
4. **Embrace**: Emergent solutions

### The Test of Success
Can it handle these without special code?
- ✅ Business decisions
- ✅ Code reviews
- ✅ Message testing
- ✅ "What would dogs think?"
- ✅ "Plan my Viking funeral"
- ✅ Anything else users imagine

## Final Thoughts

We're not building a platform with features for specific use cases. We're building pure intelligence that understands any request and creates the perfect solution. 

Monte Carlo simulations are just many agents responding independently. Panels are just agents discussing. Everything else emerges from understanding.

The product succeeds not because we anticipated every use case, but because we built true intelligence that figures out each use case as it comes.

**Remember**: Intelligence over features. Understanding over types. Emergence over templates.

This is the way.
