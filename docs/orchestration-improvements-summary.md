# Orchestration Panel Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Sidebar Layout Issues
**Problem**: Thread list was not using full width, causing title truncation and message count to wrap to new line

**Solution**:
- Increased sidebar width from `w-64` (256px) to `w-80` (320px)
- Added collapsible sidebar with toggle button
- Improved layout to prevent line breaks in thread metadata
- Used flexbox with proper spacing for date and message count

### 2. Missing Orchestration Events
**Problem**: Agent thoughts, discussions, and creation events were not appearing in the orchestration panel

**Root Cause**: The Lambda was trying to log event types (`agent_created`, `agent_thought`, `discussion_turn`) that weren't allowed by the database CHECK constraint

**Solution**: Updated Lambda code to use allowed event types:
- `agent_created` → `tool_result` with tool='createAgent'
- `agent_thought` → `thinking` with step='agent_discussion'
- `discussion_turn` → `tool_result` with tool='runDiscussion'

### 3. Duplicate Tool Calls
**Problem**: Some tools appeared twice with both success and failure states

**Analysis**: This appears to be retry logic in the orchestrator when tools fail. The orchestrator is designed to retry failed tools with different parameters.

### 4. Empty Discussion Results
**Problem**: Discussions showed "0 exchanges" even though agents were created

**Root Cause**: The discussion turn events weren't being logged due to the event type constraint issue

## Deployment Status

The Lambda has been deployed with the fixes. The orchestration panel should now show:
- Agent creation events
- Agent thoughts during discussions
- Discussion exchanges between agents
- Proper tool execution status

## Next Steps

1. Test with a new orchestration to verify events are properly logged
2. Consider adding Claude Haiku integration for more natural tool descriptions
3. Implement custom tool renderers for richer visualizations
4. Add real-time updates for long-running tools
