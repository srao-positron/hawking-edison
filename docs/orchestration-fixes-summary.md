# Orchestration System Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Missing Orchestration Events in UI
**Problem**: Agent thoughts and discussions weren't appearing in the orchestration details panel.

**Root Cause**: Lambda was trying to log event types (`agent_created`, `agent_thought`, `discussion_turn`) that weren't allowed by the database CHECK constraint.

**Fix**: Updated Lambda code to map events to allowed types:
- `agent_created` â†’ `tool_result` with `tool='createAgent'`
- `agent_thought` â†’ `thinking` with `step='agent_discussion'`
- `discussion_turn` â†’ `tool_result` with `tool='runDiscussion'`

**Files Modified**:
- `infrastructure/cdk/lambda/tools/agent.ts`
- `infrastructure/cdk/lambda/tools/interaction.ts`

### 2. Sidebar Layout Issues
**Problem**: Thread titles were truncated and message count was wrapping to new line.

**Fix**: 
- Increased sidebar width from 256px to 320px
- Added collapsible toggle functionality
- Fixed message count display to stay on same line

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`

### 3. Client Timeout Too Short
**Problem**: Client showed "Request timed out" after 5 minutes while Lambda runs for up to 14 minutes.

**Fix**: Increased client timeout from 5 to 13 minutes and added better reconnection logic for recently completed orchestrations.

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/ChatInterface.tsx` (line 618)

### 4. CI/CD Deployment Issues
**Problem**: 
- Lambda bundling was failing with "Could not resolve" errors
- GitHub workflow wasn't using deploy.sh script, missing environment variables

**Fix**:
- Marked AWS SDK as external in bundling configuration
- Updated workflow to use deploy.sh script with proper environment variables

**Files Modified**:
- `infrastructure/cdk/lib/hawking-edison-stack.ts`
- `.github/workflows/deploy-infrastructure.yml`

### 5. TypeScript Build Errors
**Problem**: Multiple TypeScript errors preventing successful build.

**Fixes**:
- Added explicit type annotations for filter/map functions
- Fixed scope issues with supabase variable declarations
- Changed `useAuth()` to use `user` property instead of non-existent `session`
- Added proper arguments to `useRef` calls

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Progress Indicators**: Show percentage completion based on tool execution
2. **Export Functionality**: Allow users to export orchestration logs
3. **Performance Metrics**: Track and display execution times for each tool
4. **Agent Visualization**: Create a graph view of agent interactions
5. **Search/Filter**: Add ability to search through orchestration events

## Testing Instructions

1. Run a complex query like "Should OpenAI buy Anthropic?"
2. Observe the Details button appear on the assistant's response
3. Click Details to view orchestration events
4. Verify agents, thoughts, and discussions are visible
5. Refresh the page and confirm Details button persists
6. Monitor for any timeout issues on long-running queries

The orchestration system is now fully functional with improved UI and reliability! ðŸš€
