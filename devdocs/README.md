## Key Documents

### üîß Tool Implementation Guide
The [TOOL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./TOOL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) provides detailed documentation on how each tool was built, including:
- Agent creation tools
- Interaction tools (discussions, interviews)
- Analysis tools with verification
- Memory system implementation
- Architecture decisions and rationale

### üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
Start with [COMPLETE_ARCHITECTURE.md](./architecture/COMPLETE_ARCHITECTURE.md) for an overview, then dive into specific areas:
- No types/templates approach
- Tool-based orchestration
- Verification at every level
- Memory as an optional tool

### üöÄ Getting Started
1. Read [DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md](./development/DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md) - these apply to every session
2. Review [TOOL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md](./TOOL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md) to understand the tools
3. Check [MASTER_PLAN_V3.md](./development/MASTER_PLAN_V3.md) for the development roadmap

## Quick Links

- **Main Project README**: [../README.md](../README.md)
- **Claude Instructions**: [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)
- **API Documentation**: [API on Postman](https://www.postman.com/your-workspace)
- **Production URL**: https://hawkingedison.com

## Core Principles

1. **No Types or Templates** - Pure natural language processing
2. **Tools, Not Features** - Simple, composable building blocks
3. **Verification Everywhere** - Every output is verified
4. **Memory is Optional** - Agents are ephemeral by default
5. **API-First** - All business logic in Edge Functions
