# Hawking Edison - TODO

## CI/CD Improvements

### âœ… Playwright Tests in CI - FIXED
Playwright tests now run in CI against the Vercel deployment URL.

- Tests use `https://hawking-edison.vercel.app` in CI
- Tests use `http://localhost:3000` for local development
- Configuration is automatic based on `process.env.CI`
