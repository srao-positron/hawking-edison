# Archived Planning Documents

This directory contains earlier versions of planning documents that have been superseded by the tool-based approach.

## Archived Files:
- DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md - Original plan with intent extraction
- PRODUCTION_PLAN_FINAL.md - Previous "no types" approach
- MASTER_PLAN.md - First unified plan

## Current Active Documents:
- ../MASTER_PLAN_V2.md - Current development plan
- ../TOOLS_SPECIFICATION.md - Tool definitions
- ../DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS_V2.md - Current standards
- ../README.md - Project overview

The key evolution was from:
1. Intent extraction → Agent creation → Execution
2. No types but still structured understanding
3. **Current: Just give LLM tools and let it orchestrate**

The current approach is the simplest and most powerful.
