ðŸ§ª Testing Orchestration UI Behavior
===================================

Previous Issues Fixed:
âœ… Details button shows on first run
âœ… Details button persists after page refresh
âœ… Lambda logs agent thoughts and discussions properly
âœ… Event types are mapped correctly to database constraints
âœ… Client timeout increased to 13 minutes (from 5)

Current Status:
- Orchestration events are properly logged with correct event types
- Agent thoughts and discussions are visible in UI
- Details button correctly shows for messages with orchestrationSessionId
- Sidebar layout improved with collapsible functionality

Test Steps to Verify:
1. Run a query that triggers orchestration (e.g., "Should OpenAI buy Anthropic?")
2. See Details button appear on assistant message
3. Click Details to see orchestration events, agents, and discussions
4. Refresh the page
5. Details button should still be visible
6. Click Details again - events should load correctly

Recent Improvements:
- Fixed Lambda event logging to use allowed event types
- Added comprehensive error handling for failed orchestrations
- Improved UI to show partial success when some operations complete
- Added sorting and filtering to timeline view
- Made agent thoughts collapsible for better readability

Known Working Features:
- Tool calls and results display correctly
- Agent creation and thoughts are tracked
- Discussions between agents are recorded
- Timeline shows all events in chronological order
- Status updates reflect orchestration progress

The system is now working as expected! ðŸŽ‰
