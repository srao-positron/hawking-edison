New Chat Button Fix Test Guide
===================================

This test verifies that the "New chat" button works correctly when viewing a historical thread.

Test Steps:
-----------
1. Open the app in the browser
2. Click on an existing chat thread in the sidebar
3. Wait for the thread messages to load
4. Click the "New chat" button
5. Verify that:
   - The URL changes to /chat (no thread ID)
   - The chat area is cleared
   - You can type and submit a new message
   - The orchestration UI appears for the new message

Expected Behavior:
------------------
- Clicking "New chat" should clear the selected thread
- The URL should update to /chat
- The chat interface should be ready for a new conversation
- No old thread should be re-selected automatically

Debug Information:
------------------
Watch the browser console for these logs:
- [createNewChat] Called
- [createNewChat] Clearing session from active chat tab
- [selectThread] Called with threadId: null
- [ChatPage] At /chat root, clearing selection

Changes Made:
-------------
1. Fixed createNewChat in chat-store.ts to properly clear sessionId
2. Added orchestration ID preservation in ChatInterface.tsx
3. Added cancel orchestration button with proper styling

If Issues Persist:
------------------
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify that the chat store is properly clearing state
3. Check if URL params are being cleared correctly
4. Look for any useEffect loops that might re-select the thread

Run this test after starting the dev server:
