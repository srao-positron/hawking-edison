# Hawking Edison v2: Immutable Development Rules
## These Rules Apply to EVERY Claude Session

### üî¥ CRITICAL: These Rules Are Non-Negotiable

These rules MUST be followed in every Claude session, regardless of context length or conversation history. If you're reading this file, these rules apply to you.

---

## Rule 1: Architecture Documents Are Law

**BEFORE writing any code**, you MUST read:
1. `API_FIRST_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Everything is an API
2. `MASTER_PLAN_V3.md` - System architecture
3. `TOOL_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md` - How to design tools
4. `DEVELOPMENT_STANDARDS_V2.md` - Code standards
5. `SYSTEM_PROMPTS.md` - Prompting strategy
6. `API_KEY_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Dual authentication system

**If a feature conflicts with these documents, STOP and DISCUSS.**

---

## Rule 2: TODO-Driven Development

When asked to build a feature, ALWAYS:

```typescript
// 1. Create TODOs immediately
TodoWrite([
  "Review existing codebase for similar features",
  "Check architecture documents", 
  "Design API endpoint",
  "Write test first",
  "Implement Edge Function",
  "Create browser API client",
  "Build UI (no logic)",
  "Create helper scripts",
  "Run tests and verify"
]);
```

---

## Rule 3: Search Before You Build

**ALWAYS search the existing codebase first:**

```bash
# Use these tools BEFORE writing new code:
- Grep: Search for similar functionality
- Glob: Find related files
- Read: Examine existing implementations

# Ask yourself:
- "Does this feature already exist?"
- "Can I extend existing code?"
- "Is there a pattern I should follow?"
```

**DO NOT create duplicate functionality.**

---

## Rule 4: API-First, No Exceptions

```typescript
// ‚ùå NEVER: Business logic in browser
function calculateInBrowser(data) {
  return complexLogic(data); // NO!
}

// ‚úÖ ALWAYS: Call API
async function calculate(data) {
  return await api.post('/api/calculate', data);
}
```

**Every feature = Edge Function + API endpoint + Simple UI**

---

## Rule 5: Test-First Development

```typescript
// Write test BEFORE implementation
// __tests__/features/new-feature.test.ts

describe('New Feature', () => {
  it('should work via API', async () => {
    const result = await api.newFeature(input);
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);
  });
});

// Only AFTER test is written, implement feature
```

---

## Rule 6: Helper Scripts Required

For every feature, create helpers in `utils/`:

```typescript
// utils/test-feature.ts - Manual testing
// utils/seed-feature-data.ts - Test data
// utils/cleanup-feature.ts - Cleanup
```

---

## Rule 7: No Types, No Templates

```typescript
// ‚ùå NEVER create:
enum PanelType { }
interface SimulationTemplate { }
class SpecificAgentType { }

// ‚úÖ ALWAYS create:
function createAgent(specification: string) // Flexible
function runInteraction(agents, instructions) // Natural language
```

---

## Rule 8: Authentication Always

```typescript
// Every API endpoint MUST support BOTH:
// 1. Session-based auth (Supabase)
// 2. API key auth (for programmatic access)

const user = await authenticate(request); // Handles both methods
if (!user) return 401;

// See API_KEY_ARCHITECTURE.md for implementation details
// No public endpoints (except auth itself)
```

---

## Rule 9: Consistent API Responses

```typescript
// ALWAYS return:
{
  success: boolean,
  data?: any,
  error?: {
    code: string,
    message: string
  }
}
```

---

## Rule 10: Document Tool Usage

When creating/modifying tools:
1. Rich parameter documentation
2. Multiple examples
3. Clear descriptions
4. No hidden behavior

---

## Workflow Checklist

### When You Receive: "Build feature X"

- [ ] 1. **Search existing code** (Grep, Glob, Read)
- [ ] 2. **Read architecture docs**
- [ ] 3. **Create TODOs** (TodoWrite)
- [ ] 4. **Find similar code** to extend
- [ ] 5. **Write test first**
- [ ] 6. **Design API endpoint**
- [ ] 7. **Implement Edge Function**
- [ ] 8. **Create browser API client**
- [ ] 9. **Build simple UI**
- [ ] 10. **Create helper scripts**
- [ ] 11. **Run tests**
- [ ] 12. **Verify architecture compliance**

---

## Red Flags That Require Discussion

**STOP and ask user if you're about to:**
- Put logic in the browser
- Create a type or template
- Skip authentication
- Build without searching existing code
- Implement without writing test first
- Create duplicate functionality
- Deviate from API-first architecture

---

## Session Persistence Note

**These rules apply even if:**
- This is a new conversation
- Context was reset
- You can't see previous messages
- User doesn't mention the rules

**The rules are in effect as long as you're in the `/hawking-edison` directory.**

---

## Quick Reference Card

```
Before coding:
1. Search existing code ‚úì
2. Read architecture ‚úì
3. Create TODOs ‚úì
4. Write test ‚úì

While coding:
- API first ‚úì
- No browser logic ‚úì
- Auth required ‚úì
- No types/templates ‚úì

After coding:
- Run tests ‚úì
- Create helpers ‚úì
- Verify standards ‚úì
```

**Remember: These aren't suggestions. They're requirements.**

---

## Rule 11: Delete Old Code - No Dead Code

**ALWAYS delete old, unused code when replacing features:**

```bash
# When replacing a feature:
1. Build the new feature
2. Verify it works with tests
3. DELETE all old code immediately
4. Push the clean version

# Examples:
- Old UI replaced? Delete ALL old components
- New API? Delete deprecated endpoints
- Changed architecture? Remove obsolete patterns
- New auth system? Delete old auth code
```

**NEVER keep "just in case" code:**
- Git history exists for a reason
- Dead code confuses developers
- Commented-out code is forbidden
- Multiple versions of same feature forbidden

**Before pushing, ask yourself:**
- "Is there any dead code?"
- "Did I delete the old implementation?"
- "Are there unused files?"

---

## Rule 12: No Pushing with Failing Tests

**NEVER push code with failing tests:**

```bash
# Before EVERY push:
npm run test:e2e  # Must pass
npm run test      # Must pass
npm run lint      # Must pass
npm run typecheck # Must pass

# If tests fail:
1. Fix the issue
2. Run tests again
3. Only push when GREEN
```

**This is why we have pre-push hooks. Respect them.**

---

## Rule 13: Test Email Addresses

**ALWAYS use @hawkingedison.com domain for test emails:**

```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT
const testEmail = `sid+he-testing-${Date.now()}@hawkingedison.com`
const testEmail = `sid+he-testing-auth-${timestamp}@hawkingedison.com`

// ‚ùå WRONG - These cause bouncebacks
const testEmail = `test@example.com`  // Blocked by Supabase
const testEmail = `test@gmail.com`    // Causes bouncebacks
```

**Format**: `sid+he-testing-<feature>-<timestamp>@hawkingedison.com`

This prevents email bouncebacks and maintains our sender reputation.
