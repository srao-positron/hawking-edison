# Orchestration Panel Fix Summary

## Issue Analysis

The orchestration panel in thread "lively-forest-52" shows:
- ✅ Tool calls are displayed correctly
- ❌ No agents shown in "Agents" section
- ❌ Discussions show "0 exchanges" 
- ❌ No agent thoughts/responses visible
- ❌ Duplicate tool calls (MCP tools called twice)

## Root Cause

The Lambda orchestrator (`hawking-edison-dev-Orchestrator6EF1216F-7Oq113p4nGQL`) is **creating agents and running discussions successfully** but is **NOT logging the required events** to the database.

### Evidence from Session `0ecd7377-7f71-4ea5-ba4b-3da16d2cd4ed`:
- 46 total events logged
- 21 tool_call events
- 21 tool_result events
- **0 agent_created events** (should be 3)
- **0 agent_thought events** (should be many)
- **0 discussion_turn events** (should be several)

## Required Lambda Fixes

### 1. Fix `createAgent` tool (in `infrastructure/cdk/lambda/tools/agent.ts`)
The tool already has code to log `agent_created` events (lines 73-84) but it's not working. Need to verify:
- The `context.supabase` client is properly initialized
- The `log_orchestration_event` RPC call is succeeding
- Error handling is not silently swallowing failures

### 2. Fix `runDiscussion` tool (in `infrastructure/cdk/lambda/tools/interaction.ts`)
The tool has code to log `discussion_turn` events but they're not appearing. Need to:
- Verify the logging code is being reached
- Check if the supabase client has proper permissions
- Add error logging if the RPC call fails

### 3. Fix `gatherIndependentResponses` tool
Need to add logging for `agent_thought` events when agents provide their responses.

## UI Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Tool Card Display (`src/components/orchestration/ToolCard.tsx`)
- ✅ Shows tool arguments in collapsed view
- ✅ Expandable details with full arguments and results
- ✅ Better formatting for MCP tool names
- ✅ Shows tool call IDs for debugging

### 2. Enhanced Discussion Display (`src/components/OrchestrationPanel.tsx`)
- ✅ Shows exchange count
- ✅ Better formatting for agent thoughts with type indicators
- ✅ Shows "waiting for responses" when no data

## Duplicate Tool Calls Issue

The MCP tools (e.g., `mcp_get_pull_request`) are being called twice because:
1. The orchestrator might be retrying failed calls
2. The UI might be showing both the original and retry

This needs investigation in the Lambda logs to understand the retry logic.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Lambda Event Logging**
   - Add detailed error logging to all `log_orchestration_event` calls
   - Verify the supabase client initialization in Lambda context
   - Test the RPC function permissions

2. **Deploy Updated Lambda**
   - Update the Lambda code with fixes
   - Test with a new orchestration session
   - Verify events are being logged

3. **Monitor Results**
   - Use `utils/diagnose-orchestration-panel.ts` to verify fixes
   - Check that all event types are present
   - Confirm UI displays the data correctly

## Testing Tools Created

1. **`utils/check-orchestration-logs.ts`** - Check logs by session or thread ID
2. **`utils/diagnose-orchestration-panel.ts`** - Diagnose missing events
3. **`utils/test-agent-logging.ts`** - Test event logging directly

## Key Finding

The orchestration system is working correctly (agents are created, discussions happen, results are generated) but the **observability layer is broken** due to missing event logging in the Lambda functions.
