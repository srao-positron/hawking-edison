## 3. Technical Architecture Recommendations

### Core Platform Stack

**Foundation (Supabase-based):**
```typescript
// Multi-tenant schema with RLS
CREATE TABLE ai_simulations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,
  simulation_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  config JSONB,
  results JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

// Enable RLS for tenant isolation
ALTER TABLE ai_simulations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**Vector Search Implementation:**
- Use **HNSW indexing** for production (40.5 QPS vs 2.6 for IVFFlat)
- Implement semantic caching to reduce costs by 10x
- Hybrid search combining vector similarity and keyword matching

**Real-time Streaming Architecture:**
```javascript
// Server-sent events for AI agent responses
const stream = new ReadableStream({
  async start(controller) {
    for await (const chunk of agentResponse) {
      controller.enqueue(new TextEncoder().encode(chunk));
    }
    controller.close();
  }
});
```

### Multi-Agent Orchestration Framework

**Recommended Architecture Pattern:**
```python
class HawkingEdisonOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agent_registry = {}
        self.simulation_engine = MonteCarloSimulator()
        self.message_queue = asyncio.Queue()
    
    async def create_synthetic_society(self, demographics, size):
        """Create AI agents representing different population segments"""
        agents = []
        for segment in demographics:
            agent = SyntheticPersona(
                beliefs=segment['beliefs'],
                behaviors=segment['behaviors'],
                demographics=segment['data']
            )
            agents.append(agent)
        return agents
    
    async def run_simulation(self, scenario, agents):
        """Execute Monte Carlo simulation with synthetic agents"""
        results = await self.simulation_engine.simulate(
            scenario=scenario,
            agents=agents,
            iterations=10000
        )
        return self.analyze_results(results)
