### 4. Panel Discussion Execution (30-45 seconds)

**Real-time streaming to user:**

```
üí¨ Panel Discussion: OpenAI-Anthropic Acquisition Analysis

Alexandra Chen (M&A Strategy):
"Let me start by framing this opportunity. I'll research the current market situation..."
üîç Using AI Market Intelligence...
"Based on recent reports, Anthropic's last valuation was $18.4B, while OpenAI is valued at $86B..."

Marcus Thompson (AI Industry):
"I'll analyze the competitive dynamics. The AI market is rapidly consolidating..."
üîç Searching your knowledge base...
"I found your research note from last month about AI market consolidation trends..."

Sarah Patel (Financial):
"Let me run the numbers on potential deal structures..."
üßÆ Running financial analysis...
"At a 30% premium, this would be a $24B acquisition. OpenAI would need to..."

David Kim (Technology):
"The technical synergies are compelling. Both companies use transformer architectures..."
üîç Analyzing technical compatibility...

Rachel Martinez (Regulatory):
"We need to consider antitrust implications. The FTC has been increasingly..."
‚öñÔ∏è Evaluating regulatory risks...

[Discussion continues with back-and-forth between panelists]
```

### 5. Consensus Building (10-15 seconds)

```
ü§ù Panel reaching consensus...

Key Points of Agreement:
‚Ä¢ Strategic fit is strong
‚Ä¢ Financial challenge is significant  
‚Ä¢ Regulatory risk is high
‚Ä¢ Technical synergies are valuable
‚Ä¢ Timing may not be optimal
```

### 6. Final Recommendation (5 seconds)

```
üìä Panel Recommendation: WAIT

The panel recommends that OpenAI should NOT pursue acquiring Anthropic at this time.

Key Reasons:
1. üí∞ Valuation too high relative to OpenAI's resources (would require $24B+)
2. ‚öñÔ∏è High regulatory risk - likely FTC challenge (70% probability)
3. üè¢ Cultural integration challenges between research-focused teams
4. üìà Better to wait for market conditions to improve

Alternative Recommendations:
‚Ä¢ Consider strategic partnership instead
‚Ä¢ Explore acqui-hire of key talent
‚Ä¢ Wait for regulatory environment to clarify
‚Ä¢ Focus on organic growth

Confidence: 7/10 (High confidence in analysis, moderate uncertainty on timing)

## Behind the Scenes: Technical Implementation

### 1. Natural Language Understanding

```typescript
class IntentParser {
  async parse(input: string): Promise<Intent> {
    // Use LLM to understand intent
    const analysis = await llm.analyze({
      prompt: `Analyze this request and extract:
        - Type of decision/analysis needed
        - Key entities involved
        - Required expertise
        - Suggested approach`,
      input: input
    });
    
    return {
      type: analysis.decisionType,
      entities: analysis.entities,
      suggestedExperts: this.matchExperts(analysis),
      requiredTools: this.identifyTools(analysis)
    };
  }
}
```

### 2. Dynamic Panel Generation

```typescript
class PanelGenerator {
  async createExpertPanel(context: Context): Promise<Panel> {
    // Generate relevant experts based on context
    const experts = await this.generateExperts({
      domain: context.domain,
      decisionType: context.type,
      count: context.complexity > 7 ? 5 : 3,
      expertise: context.requiredExpertise
    });
    
    // Create diverse perspectives
    return this.ensureDiversePerspectives(experts);
  }
}
```

### 3. Tool Generation & Verification

```typescript
class ToolGenerator {
  async generateToolsForPanel(panel: Panel, context: Context) {
    const requiredCapabilities = this.analyzeNeeds(panel, context);
    
    for (const capability of requiredCapabilities) {
      if (!this.toolExists(capability)) {
        const tool = await this.generateTool(capability);
        await this.verifyTool(tool);
        this.registerTool(tool);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Panel Orchestration

```typescript
class PanelOrchestrator {
  async runDiscussion(panel: Panel, topic: string) {
    const discussion = new Discussion(topic);
    
    // Each expert contributes based on their expertise
    for (let round = 0; round < 3; round++) {
      for (const expert of panel.participants) {
        const contribution = await expert.contribute({
          topic: topic,
          previousDiscussion: discussion.getTranscript(),
          tools: this.getToolsForExpert(expert),
          round: round
        });
        
        discussion.add(contribution);
        await this.streamToUser(contribution);
      }
    }
    
    // Build consensus
    const consensus = await this.buildConsensus(discussion);
    return this.generateRecommendation(consensus);
  }
}
```

## Demo Variations

### Variation 1: Code Review
```
Input: "I need a code review panel for my authentication system PR"
Result: Creates security expert, performance engineer, senior architect, etc.
```

### Variation 2: Marketing Message
```
Input: "Test my new product launch email with different customer segments"
Result: Creates 1000 synthetic customers, tests variations, shows results
```

### Variation 3: Policy Decision

## Demo Script for Presenters

```
"Watch this. I'm just going to type a question..."
[Types: I want to run a panel to decide whether OpenAI should buy Anthropic]

"Now watch what happens. It's going to:
- Understand this is a complex M&A decision
- Create relevant experts automatically
- Generate the tools they need
- Search my own research
- Run a full panel discussion
- Give me a recommendation

All from that one sentence."

[Let it run, narrating key moments]

"Notice how it created McKinsey analysts specifically - it understood this was a strategic business decision. And look, it's actually searching real market data, doing financial analysis..."

[At the end]

"In under a minute, I got a board-ready recommendation with full analysis. 
And I didn't configure anything - it just knew what to do."
```

This killer demo showcases the platform's core magic: turning simple natural language into sophisticated multi-agent analysis with zero configuration.
