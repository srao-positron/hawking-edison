### 4. Panel Review Discussion (45-60 seconds)

**Real-time streaming:**

```
üîç Code Review Panel - PR #347: Stripe Webhook Handling

Elena Rodriguez (Security):
"I'll start with security concerns. Scanning for vulnerabilities..."
‚ö†Ô∏è Found: Webhook signature validation looks good, but I notice the endpoint is not rate-limited.
üìã Checking: Are we logging any sensitive payment data?

James Liu (Code Quality):
"Let me review the code structure and patterns..."
‚úÖ Good: Error handling is comprehensive with custom error classes
üîß Suggestion: The webhook handler at line 156 is doing too much - should be split
üìä Complexity: Main handler function has cyclomatic complexity of 12 (high)

Priya Sharma (Performance):
"Analyzing performance implications..."
‚ö° Concern: Each webhook triggers 3 database queries that could be combined
üíæ Found: No caching strategy for customer lookups (could add 50ms per request)
üìà Recommendation: Implement Redis cache for frequently accessed payment methods

Michael Foster (API Design):
"Reviewing API patterns and webhook design..."
‚úÖ Excellent: Proper idempotency key handling
‚ö†Ô∏è Issue: Response codes don't follow our API standards (using 204 instead of 200)
üìù Missing: Webhook event type enum - using magic strings

Zhang Wei (DevOps):
"Checking production readiness..."
üö® Critical: No metrics/monitoring for webhook processing time
‚ö†Ô∏è Missing: Dead letter queue for failed webhook processing
‚úÖ Good: Graceful shutdown handling implemented
üîÑ Suggestion: Add circuit breaker for Stripe API calls

[Panel members discuss findings...]

James: "Elena raised a good point about rate limiting. Without it, we're vulnerable to webhook flooding."

Elena: "Exactly. And if webhooks fail, Zhang's point about the dead letter queue becomes critical."

Priya: "The performance impact is manageable, but those sequential queries will hurt at scale."
```

```

## Behind the Scenes: Implementation

### 1. GitHub API Integration

```typescript
class GitHubAnalyzer {
  async analyzePR(url: string) {
    const { owner, repo, number } = this.parseURL(url);
    
    // Fetch PR details
    const pr = await github.pulls.get({ owner, repo, pull_number: number });
    
    // Get file changes
    const files = await github.pulls.listFiles({ owner, repo, pull_number: number });
    
    // Analyze changes
    return {
      title: pr.data.title,
      description: pr.data.body,
      author: pr.data.user.login,
      changes: this.summarizeChanges(files.data),
      language: this.detectLanguages(files.data),
      category: this.categorizeChanges(files.data)
    };
  }
}
```

### 2. Intelligent Reviewer Selection

```typescript
class ReviewerSelector {
  async selectReviewers(prContext: PRContext): Promise<Reviewer[]> {
    const reviewerPool = {
      security: ["Authentication", "Encryption", "Input validation"],
      performance: ["Database", "Caching", "Algorithms"],
      architecture: ["Design patterns", "SOLID", "Dependencies"],
      api: ["REST", "GraphQL", "Webhooks"],
      frontend: ["React", "Vue", "Accessibility"],
      devops: ["CI/CD", "Monitoring", "Infrastructure"]
    };
    
    // Match reviewers to PR content
    const needed = this.analyzeNeededExpertise(prContext);
    return this.createReviewers(needed, prContext);
  }
}
```

### 3. Codebase Context Integration

```typescript
class CodebaseContextAnalyzer {
  async gatherContext(pr: PR, userKnowledge: KnowledgeBase) {
    // Search user's knowledge base
    const relevantDocs = await userKnowledge.search({
      query: `${pr.title} ${pr.description}`,
      filters: ["code", "architecture", "decisions"]
    });
    
    // Find similar code in repo
    const patterns = await this.findSimilarPatterns(pr.changes);
    
    // Get historical context
    const history = await this.getRelatedIssues(pr.repo);
    
    return {
      userContext: relevantDocs,
      codePatterns: patterns,
      historicalIssues: history
    };
  }
}
```

### 4. Review Orchestration

```typescript
class CodeReviewOrchestrator {
  async conductReview(panel: ReviewPanel, pr: PR, context: Context) {
    const review = new CodeReview(pr);
    
    // Each reviewer analyzes their area
    for (const reviewer of panel.reviewers) {
      const analysis = await reviewer.analyze({
        changes: pr.changes,
        context: context,
        focusAreas: reviewer.expertise
      });
      
      review.addFindings(analysis);
      await this.streamFindings(analysis);
    }
    
    // Cross-reviewer discussion
    const discussion = await this.facilitateDiscussion(review.findings);
    
    // Generate consensus
    return this.generateRecommendations(discussion);
  }
}
```

## Demo Variations

### For Non-Technical PM Sarah
```
Input: "Can you review our payment code for security issues?"
Response: Creates security-focused panel, explains findings in plain English
```

### For Senior Developer
```
Input: "Review PR #347 focusing on performance and scalability"
Response: Deep technical analysis with specific optimization suggestions
```

### For CTO
```
Input: "Review our new microservice architecture PR"
Response: High-level architecture review with strategic recommendations
```

## Success Metrics

1. **Insight Quality**: Catches real issues that human reviewers might miss
2. **Time Saved**: 5-minute automated review vs 30+ minute manual review
3. **Consistency**: Same quality standards across all PRs
4. **Learning**: Team improves based on repeated feedback patterns
5. **Integration**: Seamless GitHub workflow integration

## Key Differentiators

1. **Zero Configuration**: Just paste a URL
2. **Contextual Intelligence**: Uses your knowledge base
3. **Specialized Expertise**: Dynamic panel based on code type
4. **Actionable Output**: Specific line-by-line suggestions
5. **Workflow Integration**: Posts directly to GitHub

## Demo Talk Track

```
"Here's something for our technical users. Watch what happens when I just paste a GitHub URL..."

[Pastes URL]

"It automatically:
- Understands it's a payment webhook PR
- Creates relevant reviewers - security, performance, API design
- Reads the actual code changes
- Even checks my personal knowledge base for context

And watch - they're having a real discussion about the code..."

[Shows discussion]

"Look, the security reviewer caught a rate limiting issue, the performance reviewer found inefficient queries, and they're actually discussing the implications together.

In under a minute, you get a comprehensive code review that would typically take 30+ minutes of senior developer time."

[If integrated]: "And if I want, I can post this directly to GitHub with one click."
```

This demo proves the platform works for technical use cases while maintaining the same simplicity that non-technical users love.
